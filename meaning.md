To prevent users, especially plumbers, from publicly sharing their contact information such as phone numbers within their profiles, you can implement a combination of technical and policy-based measures:

1. **Text Filtering and Content Moderation**:
   - Implement text filtering algorithms that can scan user-generated content, including profile descriptions, for patterns resembling phone numbers.
   - Utilize machine learning algorithms to continuously improve the accuracy of filtering and to adapt to new patterns or variations.
   - Flag or automatically reject profile descriptions that contain potential contact information and notify users about the policy.

2. **User Education and Guidelines**:
   - Clearly outline the platform's policy against sharing personal contact information publicly in user guidelines and terms of service.
   - Provide prompts and reminders during the profile creation process to discourage users from including personal contact information.
   - Educate users about the risks associated with publicly sharing personal contact information and emphasize the importance of privacy and security.

3. **Automatic Detection and Enforcement**:
   - Use automated tools to detect and flag any attempts to include personal contact information in profile descriptions or other user-generated content.
   - Implement rules and algorithms to automatically reject or sanitize profiles that violate the policy against sharing personal contact information.
   - Notify users about the rejection or modification of their profile content and provide guidance on how to comply with the platform's policies.

4. **Manual Review and Enforcement**:
   - Employ human moderators or administrators to manually review flagged profiles and content for compliance with the platform's policies.
   - Provide mechanisms for users to appeal content moderation decisions and address any misunderstandings or disputes.

5. **Alternative Communication Channels**:
   - Encourage users to use the platform's built-in messaging system for communication between plumbers and clients, rather than sharing personal contact information.
   - Implement features that facilitate secure and private communication within the app, such as anonymous calling or messaging options.

6. **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement**:
   - Regularly monitor user behavior and feedback to identify any attempts to circumvent the platform's policies against sharing personal contact information.
   - Continuously update and refine the platform's moderation tools and policies based on user feedback, emerging patterns, and evolving best practices.

By combining these technical and policy-based measures, you can effectively prevent users from publicly sharing personal contact information within their profiles, thereby enhancing the security and privacy of both plumbers and clients on the KEPAS platform.
